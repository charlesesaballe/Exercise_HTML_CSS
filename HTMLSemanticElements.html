        <h2>Welcome to my two homes!</h2>
        <p>
            Thank you for visiting my blog. Here you will find my thoughts and insights about my home country the Philippines, as well as my adventures as a Filipina living in Finland.

            <h3>When food is life!</h3>
            <p>
                You know that people love their food when asking "Kumain ka na ba (Have you eaten)?" is synonymous to saying "Hello!"!
            </p>

                Filipino cuisine has developed from the different cultures that shaped its history. As such, it is a melange of Indian, Chinese, Malay, Spanish, European and American influences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though its cuisine is not as renowned as many of its neighbours, such as that of Thailand and Vietnam, Filipino cooking is nonetheless distinct in that it is possibly the least spicy of all South East Asian cuisines. 
                However, the Filipino diet is higher in total fat, saturated fat, and cholesterol than other Asian diets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't make the mistake of thinking that Filipino food is bland, though. It is just that instead of spices, Filipino food depends more on garlic, onions and ginger to add flavor to dishes. 
                Painstaking preparation and prolonged cooking time is also a characteristic of most Filipino dishes, and when done properly is often what brings out the flavor of the food as opposed to a healthy dose of spices.
            </p>
            <p>
                Filipino cuisine centres around the combination of sweet (tamis), sour (asim), and salty (alat), although in Bicol, the Cordilleras and among Muslim Filipinos, spicy (anghang) is a base of cooking flavor.

            <h3>Exploring Philippine Beaches: Boracay</h3>
            <p>
                Boracay beach is one of the top places to visit in the Philippines and has been named as the world's best island for 2016 by Conde Nast Traveler's Readers' Choice Awards. 
                This world-famous island lures travel junkies from all corners of the earth with its magnificent sunsets, powdery white sand and calm, warm, azure water ideal for swimming and snorkeling. 
                It also offers a spectacular nightlife scene that would give Ibiza – the world’s party capital – a run for its money.
